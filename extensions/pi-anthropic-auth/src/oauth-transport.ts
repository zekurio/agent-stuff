/**
 * Wraps Pi's built-in Anthropic `streamSimple` transport so OAuth request
 * shaping runs on **every** Anthropic call path, not only the main agent loop.
 *
 * Pi only threads its `before_provider_request` hook into the interactive agent
 * loop.  Auxiliary calls — built-in compaction/summarization (`completeSimple`)
 * and third-party background agents (e.g. pi-observational-memory's observer /
 * reflector / dropper running via `agentLoop`) — issue requests through the
 * same singleton API-registry transport but without that hook.  Those OAuth
 * requests then reach Anthropic with no Claude Code billing header and are
 * classified as third-party app usage, producing the misleading "extra usage"
 * HTTP 400.
 *
 * By injecting our shaping as an `onPayload` on the underlying transport, every
 * Anthropic OAuth request is shaped regardless of which Pi code path issued it.
 * The wrapper composes (does not replace) any caller-provided `onPayload`, so
 * other extensions' `before_provider_request` handlers continue to run on the
 * main loop, and our shaping is applied last — closest to the wire.
 *
 * Gating is strictly OAuth-only: when the request is not an Anthropic OAuth
 * token, the payload passes through untouched, preserving Pi's normal
 * API-key and non-Anthropic transport behavior.
 *
 * @param delegate Pi's built-in Anthropic `streamSimple` transport, resolved
 *   at runtime by `resolveBuiltinAnthropicStreamSimple` (see
 *   `src/host-transport.ts`).  Resolving it directly (rather than reading it
 *   out of the API registry) avoids infinite recursion: the registry entry for
 *   `anthropic-messages` is this wrapper, so delegating to the registry would
 *   loop.  On pi >=0.80.0, the floor also precludes the older 0.79.x
 *   lazy-registration clobber that would have displaced this wrapper on the
 *   second turn (Issue #28, fixed by the >=0.80.0 peer floor in Issue #40).
